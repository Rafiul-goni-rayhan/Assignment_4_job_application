1-> getElementById finds one ID, getElementsByClassName finds all elements of a class,on the other hand  querySelector/querySelectorAll use CSS selectors to find one or all matching elements.



2-> Create a new element using document.createElement() and insert it into the DOM using parentElement.appendChild()

3->  Event Bubbling is a process where an event starts from the specific target element and go upward through its parent elements in  DOM tree.

4-> Event Delegation involves attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events for all  future child elements, improving performance and memory.

5-> preventDefault() stops the browser's default action , while stopPropagation() prevents an event from bubbling up to parent elements.
